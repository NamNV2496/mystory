# JVM

JVM rất quan trọng vì nó là cách 1 chương trình hoạt động

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that one of the thing which enables your computer to run a Java program

A Virtual Machine is a software implementation of a physical machine. Java was developed with the concept of WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere), which runs on a VM.
The compiler compiles the Java .java file into a Java .class file, then that .class file is input into the JVM, which loads and executes the class file.

## **wore in java**

Once source code (.java file) is compiled on one platform (bytecode is formed .class file), that bytecode can be executed (interpreted) on any other platform running a JVM

## **JDK**

- JDK contains tools required to write Java programs, and JRE to execute them.
- JRE contains class libraries, JVM, and other supporting files. It does not contain any tool for Java development like a debugger, compiler, etc.
- JVM provides a platform-independent way of executing Java source code.
